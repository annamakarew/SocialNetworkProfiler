"Here at Cal Poly’s Leaning Pine Arboretum, students and faculty have been hard at work, creating an inviting space for everyone to enjoy. From lush garden care to new accessible seating, they’ve been busy preparing the five-acre living laboratory for visitors this academic year 🌱🌸

“It’s really a space for everyone,” says arboretum manager and Plant Sciences Department lecturer Tiffany Faulstich. Recently, they added about 500 feet of accessible pathways, enhancing the walking loop to welcome more visitors.",positive,"Cal, Poly, Leaning, Pine, Arboretum, Plant, Sciences, Department, Tiffany, Faulstic"

"Today marks 64 years since a plane carrying the Cal Poly football team crashed, killing 22 of the 48 people on board. Sixteen Mustang football players, the student manager, a member of the Mustang Booster Club, and four others perished on October 29, 1960.

Their legacy lives on in the heart of our campus at Memorial Plaza, just outside Alex G. Spanos Stadium. Every night at 9 pm, these pillars light up in their memory. If you’re attending the next home football game, you’ll also see our current players gather for a moment of silence under the scoreboard, honoring their 1960 teammates.
